### Summary

Have you ever wanted to commit war crimes from the comfort of your own home? If so, this is the game for you.

Players take turns scheming, conniving, and committing war crimes to be the first ~~dictator~~ player to reach 3 points.


### Purpose

Our goal with this game is two-fold. 

1. We want to provide an entertaining way to learn about geopolitics and war
2. We want to contribute 10% of all profits to humanitarian efforts by the [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/)
